Prerequisites
=============

- **IN-CORE account**
    A user must have an **IN-CORE** account. If you don’t have an account, see IN-CORE `account <account.html>`_ section.

- **Virtual environment**
    We recommend that users get familiar with Python virtual environment managers called Anaconda or Miniconda.

    * These are tools that help keep dependencies separate for different projects. If you decide, however, to use a virtual environment or manager you must do it now, in this prerequisite step.

    * An environment managers are available by downloading OS specific installers. Note that Anaconda/Miniconda distribution will include Python (Anaconda also includes a collection of over 1,500+ open source packages), so installing Python first isn't needed if you use Anaconda/Miniconda. With Anaconda you already have installed Jupyter notebook. The ``conda`` is the preferred interface for managing installations and virtual environments with the Anaconda/Miniconda Python distribution.

- `Python 3.5+ <https://www.python.org/>`_
    It is common to have more than one Python version installed on your computer. Make sure you are running the correct, Anaconda version of Python (you can check by running ``python --version``) and/or ``import sys;sys.executable`` in Python console.

- `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_
    We recommend using Jupyter Notebook for running the **pyIncore** projects. It as an open-source application that allows you to create projects (documents) that contain live Python code, visualizations and documentation. Jupyter Notebook is already installed with Anaconda distribution; it has to be installed separately in your virtual environment on Miniconda distribution.


In the next section we provide installation instructions for environment manager using `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html/>`_. Similar instructions apply to full `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_ manager. Python 3.x will be installed with both distributions. The following instructions were tested for Mac, Windows and Linux 64-bit OS (The 32-bit has not been tested yet).
