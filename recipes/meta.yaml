  description: 'pyIncore is a component of IN-CORE. It is a python package consisting of two primary components: 
  1) a set of service classes to interact with the IN-CORE web services, and 2) IN-CORE analyses. The pyIncore 
  package allows users to apply various hazards to infrastructure in selected areas, propagating the effect of 
  physical infrastructure damage and loss of functionality to social and economic impacts.'
