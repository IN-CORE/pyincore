    This class represents a physical interdependency between nodes in two different layers. It inherits from
    InfrastructureArc, where the source attribute corresponds to the dependee node and the dest attribute corresponds
    to the depender node. The depender node becomes non-functional if the corresponding dependee node is non-functional.

    Attributes
    ----------
    source_layer : int
        The id of the layer where the dependee node is.
    dest_layer : int
        The id of the layer where the depender node is.
    gamma : float
        The strength of the dependency, which is a number between 0 and 1.
